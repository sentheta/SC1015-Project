# SC1015-Project
This is a Mini-project for SC1015 (Introduction to Data & AI) which focuses on HDB resale price from Housing data set found on Kaggle.

### Contributions
@JanhaveeSingh - Data extraction, Data cleaning, Data visualisation, Gradient boosting regression 

@sentheta - Data visualisation, Data cleaning, Random forest regression, Singapore map

@thiriii - Data visualisation, Linear regression, Ridge regression, Bayesian Ridge regression

### Problem Statements
We aim to conduct a comprehensive analysis to identify the key factors influencing resale prices of HDB flats. Our analysis will seek to answer the following questions:
1) Which variables has the most impact in sale price?
2) Which model would be good for this prediction?
3) Which area has the most expensive and which has the most affordable HDB?

### Models Used
1) Linear regression 
2) Bayesian Ridge regression
3) Random forest regressor 
4) Gradient boosting regressor

### Visualisation
We also created a very cool map of Sinagpore which is interactive

### Libraries used
1) Pandas
2) seaborn
3) matplotlib.pyplot
4) sklearn (framework)

### Conclusion
