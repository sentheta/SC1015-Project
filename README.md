# SC1015-Project
This is a Mini-project for SC1015 (Introduction to Data Science & AI) utilizing HDB data set from Kaggle. We aim to conduct a comprehensive analysis to identify the key factors influencing resale prices of HDB flats and our analysis will seek to answer the following questions in problem statements.

### Problem Statements
We aim to conduct a comprehensive analysis to identify the key factors influencing resale prices of HDB flats. Our analysis will seek to answer the following questions:
1) Which variables has the most impact in sale price?
2) Which model would be good for this prediction?
3) Which area has the most expensive and which has the most affordable HDB?

### Libraries
1) Pandas
2) Seaborn
3) Matplotlib
4) Sklearn
5) Folium

### Visualisation
1) Bar plot
2) Box plot
3) Violin plot
4) Scatter plot
5) Time series plot
6) Correlation heatmap
7) Interactive map of Singapore (in notebook + as html files)

### Models Used
1) Linear regression
2) Ridge regression
3) Bayesian ridge regression
4) Gradient boosting regressor
5) Random forest regressor
